*Research Interests*: /Computational Math and Statistical Analysis /\n\n I have a broad interest in tackling challenging problems where data are high dimensional. In particular, I am interested in [papersCat.html\#CC {{<font color=red size=+0.5><b>}}Double Descent phenomenon{{</b></font>}}].
  
I am currently a first-year graduate student at Georgia Tech, and I am very fortunate to be advised by [https://people.math.gatech.edu/~wliao60/ Wenjing]. Prior to that, I received my bachelor's degree from [https://en.scgy.ustc.edu.cn/ School of Gifted Young] at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).

In this paper, we study the nonlinear inverse problem of estimating the spectrum of a system matrix, that drives a 
finite-dimensional affine dynamical system, from partial observations of a single trajectory data. In the noiseless case, we prove an 
annihilating polynomial of the system matrix, whose roots are a subset of the spectrum, can be uniquely determined from data. We then 
study which eigenvalues of the system matrix can be recovered and derive various sufficient and necessary conditions to characterize the
relationship between the recoverability of each eigenvalue and the observation locations. We propose various reconstruction algorithms,
with theoretical guarantees, generalizing the classical Prony method, ESPIRIT, and matrix pencil method. We test the algorithms over a 
variety of examples with applications to graph signal processing, disease modeling and a real-human motion dataset. The numerical 
results validate our theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, even when the data did not follow 
an exact linear dynamical system.

In this thesis, we study the hybrid Eulerian/ Lagrangian Material Point Method (MPM) and propose a new discretization for the weak form 
of MPM based on the weak form of force balance and alleviated the energy dissipation. We improve the stability and energy dissipation 
compared with MPM and Affine Particle in Cell method. We implemented a Java Graphical User Interface (GUI) for visualization of our 
algorithm for snow simulation.
